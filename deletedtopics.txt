						<h2 id="withholdingtax">Withholding Tax Forms</h2>
			<p>When you are paid advances or royalties from Japan, your income is subject to deduction of Japanese income tax at a statuatory rate of 20%.  This is called the <em>withholding tax</em> because the tax amount is withheld at source and paid by your Licensee on your behalf to the National Tax Agency of Japan.  </p>
			<p>However, it is possible to apply for a lower tax rate, or even be granted withholding tax exemption (in the case of US or UK residents), by submitting  the necessary forms together with some required certificates to the Japanese tax office, by the day before your royalty is due to be paid to you.  This section of the website provides links to information, and the necessary application forms to allow you to take advantage of these tax treaty reductions and exemptions.
