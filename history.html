		<p>
		The Tuttle-Mori Agency is the oldest established, and biggest
		literary agency in Japan -- accounting for approximately 60% of
		the market.
		</p>
		<p>
		Since its inception in 1948 as the literary agency department of
		the Charles E. Tuttle & Company, the agency has opened up the
		Japanese market  for best-selling fiction and non-fiction
		authors such as Frederick Forsyth, John Grisham, Patricia
		Cornwell, Dan Brown, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Rachel Carson and
		Peter Drucker, as well as the more literary Saul Bellow, Gabriel
		Garcia Marquez, and Norman Mailer, and many children's writers
		and illustrators including Beatrix Potter, Tove Jansson, Roald
		Dahl, and Eric Hill.
		</p>
		<p>
		In 1978 the literary agency department became the Tuttle-Mori
		Agency --  taking the names of its two founders Charles E.
		Tuttle and Tom Mori.  In subsequent years, the agency has 
		continued to new areas of business for foreign rights owners,
		providing a strong presence in the market for foreign television
		distributors such as the UK's Channel 4 International and
		National Geographic Television International.  The company is
		also active in the licensing of Japanese works abroad, in areas
		such as the licensing of Japanese manga translation rights to
		over 20 countries around the world, as well as in the licensing
		of movie adaptation rights to both Japanese and western works.
